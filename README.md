# üåé Spatial Downscaling of GRACE Data with Google Earth Engine, Python & Random Forest

This repository provides a complete workflow for processing and spatially downscaling GRACE (Gravity Recovery and Climate Experiment) satellite data using Google Earth Engine, Python, and Random Forest machine learning techniques.

The goal is to improve the spatial resolution of GRACE data from approximately 55 km to 10 km, making it more suitable for local and regional hydrological applications.



## üõ†Ô∏è Requirements
Google Earth Engine Python API, geemap

Python libraries: scikit-learn, pandas, numpy, matplotlib



## üì∏ Example Outputs
