# Spatial Downscaling of GRACE Data using Google Earth Engine & Python
This repository contains code for processing GRACE (Gravity Recovery and Climate Experiment) satellite data along with various hydrological and environmental variables, including:

Precipitation

Evaporation

Land Surface Temperature (LST)

Air Temperature

NDVI (Normalized Difference Vegetation Index)

Humidity

Runoff

The objective of this project is to improve the spatial resolution of GRACE data from ~55 km to ~10 km using Random Forest machine learning techniques.
